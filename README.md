# Card Game
A card game that allows the player to go against a computer.

# Purpose
I started getting into playing black jack and always couldn't play with family members. So,
I created a card game that allowed me to go against the computer.

# How it works
The game starts with displaying the user points and hand. The user can add a hand or stand.

# Functions
- draw() Allow the dealer to draw a card from the deck

- add_hand() Add the dealer hands togther and return the score

- remove_card() Remove the card from dealers hand

- place_card_back() Place the card back into the dealers hand

# Challenges
The challenges I had were the developing the game logic for the player and dealer. I want to next time create files for
seperate classes for organizational purposes. I feel that I could of shrunk my project but we all start from somewhere.
